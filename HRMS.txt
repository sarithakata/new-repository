Functions of HRMS Systems

The function of the human resources department involves tracking employee histories, skills, abilities, salaries, and accomplishments. Replacing certain processes with various levels of HRMS systems can distribute information management responsibilities so that the bulk of information gathering is not delegated strictly to HR. By allowing employees to update personal information and perform other tasks, information is kept more accurate and HR professionals are not bogged down.

Each module performs a separate function within the HRMS that helps with information gathering or tracking. HRMS modules can assist with:

Managing payroll
Recruitment and onboarding
Gathering, storing, and accessing employee information
Keeping attendance records and tracking absenteeism
Performance evaluation
Benefits administration
Learning management
Employee self-service
Employee scheduling
Analytics and informed decision making
